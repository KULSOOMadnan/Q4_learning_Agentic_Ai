  <h1>Overview of Tool Calling 🛠️🤖</h1>
  
  <h2><b>What is Tool Calling? ❓</b></h2>
  <p>
    Tool calling is a process in AI where the model uses external functions, APIs, or tools to perform tasks it can’t do alone,
    like fetching real-time data, calculating something complex, or interacting with a system. It’s like giving the AI a set of tools
    (e.g., a calculator, a weather API, or a database) to extend its abilities beyond just generating text.

  <h2><b>Analogy: A Chef in a Kitchen 👨‍🍳🍹</b></h2>
  <p>
    Imagine you're at a restaurant and ask the chef (the AI) for a smoothie. The chef doesn't blend fruit with their hands—they use a blender (a tool). 
    They put fruit in the blender, press the button (call the tool), get the smoothie, and serve it to you.

  <h2><b>Key Terms Explained 📖🔍</b></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Tool 🧰</b>: A tool is a pre-written piece of code (a function, API, or program) designed to do a specific job, 
      like calculating numbers, checking the weather, or searching a database. Think of it as a kitchen appliance 
      (e.g., a blender) that does one task well.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Calling 📞</b>: Calling means the AI activates or "uses" the tool by sending it the right inputs and getting the output. 
      It’s like pressing the "blend" button on a blender to make a smoothie.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tool Calling 🔄</b>: The process of the AI recognizing it needs a tool, selecting the right one, sending data to it, 
      and using the result to answer your question.
