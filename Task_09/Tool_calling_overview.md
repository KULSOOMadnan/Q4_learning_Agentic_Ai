  <h1>Overview of Tool Calling 🛠️🤖</h1>
  
  <h2><b>What is Tool Calling? ❓</b></h2>
  <p>
    Tool calling is a process in AI where the model uses external functions, APIs, or tools to perform tasks it can’t do alone,
    like fetching real-time data, calculating something complex, or interacting with a system. It’s like giving the AI a set of tools
    (e.g., a calculator, a weather API, or a database) to extend its abilities beyond just generating text.
